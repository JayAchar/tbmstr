# mSTR regional data set analysis plan

## Introduction

Since we have a well recorded time axis, we should conduct a time-to-event
analysis. The event would need to be `unsuccessful` outcome, which I think
is defined in the original study protocol. 


## Inclusion

Include a flow diagram to illustrate cohort selection:




## Descriptive

This section of the analysis will focus on describing the overall study 
cohort. We would need to describe both the `effectiveness` and `safety` cohorts
separately.

The `effectiveness` cohort should include all participants that could have
received a valid study outcome - i.e exclude people who were withdrawn due
to delayed DST results, but retain those that had their treatment extended due
to 'clinical failure'.

The `safety` cohort should include all participants who received at least one
treatment dose. 

I suggest including the following variables in Table 1: 

* Age,
* Sex,
* Country,
* BMI,
* TB episode category - e.g. new, previously treated 
     * possibly treatment after failure, treatment after LTFU
* X-ray findings - e.g. cavities - no, unilateral, bilateral
* Baseline smear microscopy grade,
* Comorbidities:
    * HIV infection 
    * HBV
    * HCV
    * Diabetes
    * COVID-19

### Primary effectiveness analysis

Perform this analysis only on the `effectiveness` cohort. 

Note that death or LTFU during post-treatment follow-up will be categorised
as an unfavourable outcome.

### Primary safety analysis

To evaluate cumulative incidence rate, timing of onset of Serious Adverse 
Events and adverse events of interest of grade 3 and greater by severity scale 
among patients receiving therapy with mSTR.
