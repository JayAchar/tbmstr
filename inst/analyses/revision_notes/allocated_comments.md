# Allocated comments from LID editors & reviewers

## Editor's comments

- [x] "14". Provide editable figures - .pdf files

- [ ] "15". Review which figures/tables should be moved to the appendix

- [ ] "19". Check that 95% CI are reported and that exact p-values are reported
      unless < 0.0001

- [ ] "28". The primary outcome is defined as time to unsuccessful study outcome, but
      that is now how the outcome is reported in the results and statistical analysis
      section. Please be consistent with the planned analysis.

- [x] "20": Please provide numbers at risk for Kaplan-Meier plots and ensure that
      plots include a measure of effect (e.g, log-rank p); estimates should be
      reported with 95% CIs.

## Reviewer comments

- [ ] Methods: "Participants were censored at the earlier date of LTFU after
      successful treatment or 703 days following treatment initiation": is unclear
      to me. Please explain with more detail. Was any lab test needed to consider
      a patient to be cured relapse-free and censor at the end of post-treatment
      follow-up? What if a patient was retained in care during post-treatment
      follow-up but recurrence was not bacteriologically assessed?
- [ ] Sometimes you use 703 days, sometimes before 21 months. I suggest to be
      coherent, or to make the link explicitly.
- [ ] It would be good to show the audience descriptive data about post-treatment
      follow-up after a successful end-of-treatment outcome. How many of those
      treated successfully had complete post-treatment follow-up? How many had
      recurrence?
- [x] Results: "Following adjustment for strongly-associated factors" means what?
      Is this term specified in the methods?
- [ ] Limitations: "high post-treatment loss to follow-up amongst those that were
      successfully treated" I missed these findings on post-treatment loss to
      follow-up in the results section
- [x] In table 4, please include likelihood ratio test p-values for the global
      effect of each characteristic with multiple levels. Wald p-values as displayed
      currently, can be over interpreted when there is no evidence of a global association
- [ ] The outcome definitions section is short and incomplete. The primary
      effectiveness outcome is described as the 'time to an unsuccessful outcome',
      yet in the statistical analysis section this is described as 'the cumulative
      probability of not experiencing an unsuccessful study outcome before 21
      months of study follow-up'. The latter description is a better description of
      the results presented, so please alter the text in the Outcome definitions
      section to reflect this. The outcome definition section should also include
      descriptions of the secondary outcomes.
- [x] Count the number of pregnant women that were included.
